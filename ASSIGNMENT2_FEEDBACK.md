Hi Jenny!

Great work! A few minor comments below, but it works well and the code is at a high level.

Only thing I would have liked to see is usedLetters  on every prompt, and you probably could have only used prompts - eg move the info from the alerts into the prompt so the user has less clicks to play the game.

But most requirements are met and the code quality is 10/10 so it's a Välgokänt, well done! And the God Jul screen was such a lovely surprise!
